#Amaranthus_comparative
#Comparative genomics analysis of Amaranthus weeds and crop
#This repository contains scripts used to compare genomes of weedy and cultivated amaranths.
#specifically, the KnKs_genes.py script takes the output of SynMap2 comparisons of coding sequences, identifies genes under positive selection (kn/Ks>1) and outputs helpful statistics
